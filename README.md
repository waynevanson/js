# `JS`

All the modules I'll ever create for the JavaScript ecosystem under one roof!

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress, therefore no instructions on how to use it.
There's small amount of information to run it yourself in the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why?

1. Reduce the maintenance burden integrating JS tools together. One repository, one config and only one pattern to follow.
2. Selfish reasons - Really easy to show employers how familiar I am with the ecosystem.
